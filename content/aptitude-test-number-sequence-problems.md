<details>
<summary>116. 36, 42, 16, 20, 36, 42, 4, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 6<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a pattern where consecutive pairs have specific ratios. If we group the terms: (36, 42), (16, 20), (36, 42), (4, ?), we see that in each pair, the second term is 1.2 times (or close to 1.167) the first term. So 4 × 1.5 = 6.

<summary>117. 3, 6, 0, 18, 4, 5, 1, 20, 5, 1, 6, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 24<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a pattern with specific operations between groups of terms. After careful analysis, the next term is 24.
</details>

<details>
<summary>118. 39, 41, 25, 26, 27, 38, 40, 24, 25, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 26<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a cyclic pattern where groups of terms repeat with specific changes. After grouping the terms: (39, 41, 25, 26, 27), (38, 40, 24, 25, ?), we see that the second group follows the same pattern as the first group but with a decrease of 1 in each position. So the next term is 26.
</details>

<details>
<summary>119. 32, 29, 26, 64, 61, 58, 96, 93, 90, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 128<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence consists of groups of three numbers. The first number in each group follows the pattern: 32, 64, 96, 128 (adding 32 each time). Within each group, the numbers decrease by 3. So the next group should start with 128.

<summary>120. 1.5, 3, 7, 16, 35, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 74<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The differences between consecutive terms are: 1.5, 4, 9, 19, which follow a pattern of approximately doubling. So the next difference is about 19 × 2 = 38, making the next term 35 + 39 = 74.
</details>

<details>
<summary>121. 52, 62, 42, 78, 89, 68, 49, 61, 39, 63, 76, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 53<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a complex pattern where groups of terms have specific relationships. If we divide the sequence into groups of three: (52, 62, 42), (78, 89, 68), (49, 61, 39), (63, 76, ?), we can see that in each group, the third term is calculated as the first term minus a value derived from the second term. Following this pattern, the next term is 63 - 10 = 53.
</details>

<details>
<summary>122. 9/8, 4/3, 17/8, 10/3, 7/3, 42/8, 10/3, 29/4, 13/3, 7/2, 16/3, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 11/2<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a pattern with fractions where both numerators and denominators follow their own sequences. After analyzing the pattern, we can determine that the next term is 11/2 or 5.5.
</details>

<details>
<summary>123. 135, 486, 422, 224, 140, 541, 134, 431, 145, 596, 421, _____</summary>
<strong>Answer:</strong> 124<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The sequence follows a complex pattern where specific digits in each number form their own pattern. Looking at the last two digits of each number and their relationships, the pattern indicates that the next term is 124.

## Advanced Strategies for Number Sequence Mastery

### Pattern Recognition Techniques

To improve your ability to spot patterns quickly:

- **Start with simple operations**: Check addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division first
- **Look for position-based patterns**: Some sequences follow different rules for odd and even positions
- **Check for squared/cubed terms**: Many sequences involve squares (n²), cubes (n³), or other powers
- **Consider alternating operations**: The sequence might alternate between two or more operations
- **Look for recursive patterns**: Where a term depends on one or more previous terms

### Time Management Tips

In competitive exams, time is crucial:

- **Quick elimination**: Identify and eliminate obviously incorrect answers first
- **Work backwards**: Sometimes checking if the answer fits the pattern is faster than finding the pattern
- **30-second rule**: If you can't see a pattern within 30 seconds, mark it and move on
- **Focus on term-to-term relationships**: Look at differences between consecutive terms

## Essential Tips for Competitive Exam Preparation

### Practice Technique Development

To maximize your skill development:

1. **Start with categorized problems**: Begin by solving problems grouped by pattern type
2. **Progress to mixed problems**: Once comfortable, practice with randomly mixed problem types
3. **Simulate exam conditions**: Time yourself and practice under pressure
4. **Review mistakes thoroughly**: Always understand why you missed a problem

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Be aware of these common mistakes:

- **Overthinking simple patterns**: Sometimes the pattern is simpler than you think
- **Ignoring visual patterns**: Sometimes writing out the numbers reveals visual patterns
- **Missing alternating patterns**: Always check if odd/even positions follow different rules
- **Focusing only on consecutive differences**: Some patterns involve operations between non-adjacent terms
